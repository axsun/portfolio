         <h2>Symbolic Systems - HCI @ Stanford</h2>
         <p>Beep beep bloop bloop.</p>
         <p>Hey there! My name is Alanna Sun (沈曦) and I'm a current senior at Stanford University in the graduating class of 2022. As a Symbolic Systems major on the HCI track, I am interested in UX/UI design, especially when it comes to AI-infused systems. I'm also minoring in creative writing and comparative literature My passion lies in the intersection of design for social impact, AI, and storytelling.  </p>
         <p>I have always loved stories because they allow us to see the world through the eyes of another, and for me, design is another medium of storytelling. My favorite novels are <i>Bitter in the Mouth</i> by Monique Truong and <i>The Alchemist</i> by Paulo Coelho.</p>
