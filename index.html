         <h2>Symbolic Systems - HCI @ Stanford</h2>
         <p>Hey there! My name is Alanna Sun (沈曦) and I'm a current senior at Stanford University in the graduating class of 2022. As a Symbolic Systems major on the HCI track, I am interested in UX/UI design, especially when it comes to AI-infused systems. I'm also minoring in creative writing. My passion lies in the intersection of design for social impact, AI, and storytelling.  </p>
         <p>I have always loved stories because they allow us to see the world through the eyes of another, and for me, design is another medium of storytelling. My favorite novels are <i>Bitter in the Mouth</i> by Monique Truong and <i>The Alchemist</i> by Paulo Coelho.</p>

            <p>Train Ride Home is an audiovisual storytelling software conveying the malleability and whimsicality of memory, imagination, and nostalgia. It offers a glimpse into the lives of the familiar strangers we might find ourselves sharing the same train car with. Each person has their own worries and musings that don't seem to really go anywhere. In short, it's a story about the random, small things in life. <a href= "https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~axsun/256a/final/"> Available for download here!</a></p>

<iframe width="700" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oeQMVOS7m50" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
            <p>I really wanted to make a sequencer out of a Rubik's cube because I was absolutely obsessed with Rubik's cubes back in the day. Each side of the cube corresponds to a different audio sample that has been broken up into six segments, where each color maps to a segment. The goal is to have fun experimenting with different combinations of sides, patterns, and rotations to make music! When a side is active/playing it will glow, and the map on the top left shows you the position of the cube piece that is currently playing. </p>

<p>Unity animation is based on audio timing from ChucK, which tells Unity via a global int, which cube is currently playing. The status of each face of the cube is kept in an int array, which is then reported to ChucK so that ChucK knows which segments of each sample to play.

           <p> Through this audiovisualizer, I wanted to convey a sense of whimsicality with the idea of birds arguing with each other through the spectrum while standing on a telephone line that’s the waveform. After arguing all night and into dawn, they suddenly find themselves in another galaxy, where their argument has exploded into an infinite space, and there are other birds waiting for them on the other side. The main idea that I wanted to express is that we often get caught up in the heat of the moment during an argument, and it might feel like the end of the world, but then, when we zoom out, we realize that it’s really quite silly, and that on the flip side, arguments are also a byproduct of caring about someone. The program takes in audio from the user's microphone and visualizes the waveform and spectrum + spectrum history in real-time. Check out the full journey of builiding this audiovisualizer <a href=

           <p>Potluck came out of a team project to develop an app that seeks to address digital wellbeing among families. Potluck bridges the gap between screen time and family time, drawing on individual screen time to create meaningful, shared experiences and conversations for the household. We want to help families and friends feel inspired to try new activites together, and turn the content they picked up online into mutual interests.

          <center><img src = "images/moodboard.png" alt = "Pawbook Poster"></center>
          <p>The goal of this project was to redesign Carta, a course explorer platform for Stanford students, as an AI-infused system. I worked on a team of three to conduct comparator research and continuous RITE testing, generate mood boards, brand designs + style tiles, and three rounds of wireframe iterations (from black and white low-fi to med-fi). We ultimately created a med-fi Carta redesign prototype with a schedule compatability feature that calculates a course's synergy score based on the user's goals for the semester. <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/sHcPBdkGe2hU4OuJIUPl7U/Designs?node-id=219%3A46">Figma mockups accessible here!</a></p>

          <center><img src = "images/pawbook.png" alt = "Pawbook Poster"></center>
          <p>A super fun project investigating the secret lives of pets! We approached the domain of dogs and dogowners with a narrowed scope centered around the question: "What do you do with your dog when you don't know what to do?" Through a four-day dairy study, 10+ subsequent interviews, and grounded theory synthesis, we tapped into some key pain points of dogowners that highlighted a core need leading to the HMW that kicked off our solution brainstorm: "How might we help dog owners feel less embarrassed when training and disciplining their dogs in public?"
          The result was pawbook!

            <p>As part of the final project for CS 278: Social Computing, my team and I created Brio, a web-based platform for college students to build a safe local community when they leave campus, and to find compatible matches with whom they can explore their new neighborhood. Participants complete a survey and are paired with one another based on their responses through our matching algorithm.</p>
